  .notes The problem for the simple view is that it makes exactly the wrong prediction about infants' reaching behaviours.
  .notes This problem arises twice, once for object permanence and again for causal interactions.
  .notes In the case of object permanence, the problem is 
    | that four and five month old infants appear to be surprised when a solid object is placed behind a drawbridge 
    | and then the drawbridge rotates back 180 degrees as if the object wasn't there.  
    | But if you put a desirable object behind a screen, these infants won't ever search behind the screen for the object. 
    | So if we measure their looking behaviours, they seem to know that an object is behind the screen; 
    | but if we measure their searching behaviours they seem not to know this.

  .notes The problem for the simple view is that it correctly predicts looking behaviours but not searching behaviours.
  .notes This problem arises a second time in the case of infants' abilities to track causal interactions.
  .notes Suppose you roll a ball down this ramp and remove it from behind one of the doors.
  .notes You can predict where the ball will stop because you can see this barrier sticking up here.
  .notes 2 and 2.5 year olds will look longer if you remove it from any door other than the right one.
  .notes These children and infants can also predict the location of the object (not just identify a violation, but look forward to where the object is) \citep{mash:2006_what}.
  .notes But if you ask them to remove the ball (and offer them a reward for doing so), 
    | the two year olds will typically choose a favourite door to open every time regardless of where the barrier is  
    | (incidentally this is not random but seems to be based on momentum \citep{perry:2008_representational}), 
    | and the 2.5 year olds will choose a door adjacent to the barrier but do not prefer the door on the correct side of the barrier.

  .notes The failure to reach is a problem for the simple view because it predicts that children will correctly retrieve the ball.

  .notes.handout \emph{Discovery 3}  The simple view generates systematically false predictions (about reaching).
  .notes So we have to reject it.
  .notes We were led to the simple view by Question 2, What is the relation between the principles of object perception and infants' looking behaviours?
  .notes.handout \emph{Question 2a} #{qq.q2a}
  .notes Infants abilities to segment objects, represent them as persisting and to track their causal interactions involve what many researchers call 'expectations'.
  .notes What  is the nature of these expectations?  On the simple view, these expectations are knowledge states or beliefs.  But the systematic discrepancies between looking and searching provides compelling evidence that they are not.
  .notes So what are these expectations?

  .notes We'll see later that the problem is quite general.
  .notes It doesn't arise only in the case of knowledge of objects but also in other domains (like knowledge of number and knowledge of mind).
  .notes And it doesn't arise only from evidence about infants or nonhuman primates; it would also arise if our focus were exclusively on human adults.
  .notes More on this later.
  .notes For now, our aim is to consider proposed solutions to the problem.

  p.center why?
  .notes Why is this important?
  .notes The discovery of infant abilities presents us with a dilemma.
  .notes If we follow researchers like Michael Tomasello in dismissing infants' abilities to focus on social interactions, culture and language, we miss something important about the origins of knowledge.  We will miss the fact that coming to know things about physical objects (and colours, and mind and more besides) involves multiple layers of representation.
  .notes But if we follow researchers like Spelke and Baillargeon is discussing infants' abilities as if they were based on knowledge, belief and inference, we will also miss something important about the origins of knowledge.  We will miss the fact that infants' abilities, although essential for later developments, are only indirectly related to the knowledge of physical objects that adult humans enjoy.
  .notes The challenge is to avoid this dilemma, to provide a theoretical framework that will allow us to understand how infants' abilities support the emergence of knowledge without themselves amounting to knowledge.
