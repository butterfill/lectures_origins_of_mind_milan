    .notes This course is based on a simple question. The question is, 
    .handout \textbf{Question}
      .notes: :t() 
        How do humans first come to know  about---and to knowingly manipulate---objects, 
        causes, words, numbers, colours, actions and minds?
    .notes: :t()
      We are going to approach this question by examining the evidence from developmental science, 
      exploring how it bears on philosophical positions like nativism and empiricsm, 
      and identifying philosophical problems created by the evidence.

  .notes: :t()
    At the outset we know nothing, or not very much.  (Like Lucas here.)
    Sometime later we do know some things.
    How does the transition occur?

    This is not a new question. 
    There is a family of questions about the origins of mind that philosophers have 
    been asking since Plato or before.

    .notes Fodor mentions cognitive psychologists rather than philosophers.  We will need to face up to the question of why philosophers are asking this question about the origins of knowledge, why is isn't just a scientific question.  But that's something for later.
