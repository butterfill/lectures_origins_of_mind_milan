        <div class="notes">In this lecture I want to   consider two interlocking themes simultaneously.
The first is the problem I introduced in the last lecture, which arises from
the failure of the Simple View.
The problem is to understand the relation between infants' abilities regarding physical objects
and the Spelke principles which describe these given that the principles and their deliverances
are not actually knowledge.
The other theme is knowledge of causal interactions.

On causal interactions, my question is: How do infants first acquire knowledge of causal 
interactions among objects.
I want to approach this question in an odd way, by thinking about the perception of causation
in adults.
My hope is that focussing on the perception of causation might help us to make progress 
with both themes simultaneously.

        <p>two interlocking themes:
          <ul>

  <div class="notes">I also want to complicate things by considering another question in this lecture.
The question is,
What is the relation between infants' competencies with objects and adults'?
Is it that infants' competencies grow into more sophisticated adult competencies?
Or is it that they remain constant throught development, and are supplemented by quite 
separate abilities?

        <div class="notes handout">Infants at around six months of age seem also to distinguish launching from other sequences, much as adults do \citep{Leslie:1987nr}.</div>
        <div class="notes">[nb: Several people have discussed this in seminars so I won't discuss it here (the reference is on your handout).]
        </div>
        <div class="notes">In their experiment, they compared two groups of infants.
The first group was habituated to the top display, which is just the sort of animation Michotte
used to get reports of causal experiences in adults.
After habituation, this first group was then shown the same display except that the direction was 
reversed.
Meanwhile a second group was habituated to a display like the top display here except 
that there was a delay between the first object stopping and the second object starting.
This delay would mean that, in adults, there are no reports of experiences of a causal interaction.
After habituation, this second group was shown the same display except that the direction of 
movement was reversed.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Of interest was whether the first group showed greater dishabituation to the reversal than 
the second group.
How could this tell us anything about infants' experiences?
Suppose that infants do not have anything like what adults report as an experience of causation.
They they experience merely patterns of movement.
And, in this case, reversing on sequence should create no more interest than reversing the other.
But now suppose that infants do have something like what adults report as an experience 
of causation?
Then, when reversing the first sequence, there are two changes: there is a change both to the 
movement and to the character of the causal interaction.  To put it informally,
reversing direction means that the patient of the interaction becomes its agent.
So the hypothesis that infants' experiences of Michotte-like stimuli resemble adults 
predicts that there will be greater dishabituation when the first, `direct launching` sequence 
is reversed.

        <div class="notes">Part of the answer is this.  We don't worry about the content of the verbal reports.
We just focus on the fact that their content changes depending on a tiny, 50 millisecond
difference in the delay between two movements.

So it can't be a consequence of thinking about the interaction.
Still, it might be a consequence of perceiving objects in certain relations to each other.
However a key finding shows that this is wrong.
Surprisingly, we don't first perceive objects and then get the launching effect;
rather, the launching effect is tied up with perceptual process of identifying objects' surfaces.

        <div class="notes">This is an important question insofar as we are concerned with detecting causal interactions.
Is what people detect when the launching effect occurs a causal interaction?
You might say, it can't be because no delay between two movements is consistent with a causal 
interaction.

          <p class="em-above notes show">‘anyone not very familiar with the procedure involved in framing the physical concepts of 
inertia, energy, conservation of energy, etc., might think that these concepts are simply

          <div class="notes">How is this consistent with the laws of mechanics—surely no pause can be tolerated? 
Ingeniously, Michotte compares launching with the movement of a single object. The single 
object moves half way across a screen then pauses before continuing to move. Michotte found 
that the longest pause between the two movements consistent with subjects experiencing them 
as a single movement is around 80ms, exactly the longest pause consistent with experiences 
characteristic of launching \citep[pp.\ 91--8, 124]{Michotte:1946nz}. Accordingly, the 
experience characteristic of launching appears to require that the two movements be experienced 
as uninterrupted—this is why they can be separated by a pause of up to but no longer than 80ms.

        </div>
        <p>Perceptual systems identify certain kinds of causal interaction in the course of tracking objects.</p>
        <div class="notes">The perceptual system responsible for identifying objects must also concern itself with certain 
kinds of causal interaction in order to reconcile conflicting cues to object identity.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">In slightly more detail: one function of our perceptual systems is to identify and track 
objects; this is done by means of various cues; sometimes the visual system is faced with 
conflicting cues to object identity which need to be resolved in order to arrive at a 
satisfactory interpretation; when certain types of causal interaction occur there is a 
conflict among cues to object identity; these conflicts must be treated differently from other 
conflicts because they do not indicate failures of object identification and so do not  
require resolution or further perceptual processing. 
So object perception depends on sensitivity to certain types of causal interaction and this is 
why the launching effect occurs.

          <div class="notes">The Simple View is one way to get a mechanism out of the principles.
Recall that the \emph{simple view} is the view that the principles of object perception are things that we know, and we generate expectations from these principles by a process of inference..

          <div class="notes">Unfortunately, as we saw, the Simple View is wrong.
We know it is wrong because it makes systematically incorrect predictions about infants' actions.
These arise from a discrepancy between measures that involve looking times or eye movements
and measures that involve 
other kinds of action, such as searching and pulling.

        <div class="notes">The discovery that the principles of object perception characterise the operation of 
object-indexes doesn't mean we have met the challenge exactly.
We haven't found a way of describing the processes and representations that underpin infants'
abilities to deal with objects and causes.
However, we have reduced the problem of doing this to the problem of characterising how 
some perceptual mechanisms work.  
And this shows, importantly, that understanding infants' minds is not something different from
understanding adults' minds, contrary to what Davidson assumes.
The problem is not that their cognition is half-formed or in an intermediate state.
The problem is just that understanding perception requires science and not just intuition.

          <div class="notes">Let me make some more points about it.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">First, it doesn't fully answer our question about the relation between the Principles of Object
Perception and mechanisms in infants.  
It tells us that the Principles characterise a certain kind of perceptual process.
This is progress; but we can still ask about the nature of the procesess and representations 
involved.  This will become important when we consider knowledge in other domains.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Second, we haven't fully explained the discrepancy between looking and action-based measures for 
representing objects as persisting and tracking their causal interactions.
After all, why do these perceptual representations of objects--the object indexes--not guide 
purposive actions like reaching and pulling?
This is an issue we shall return to.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Third, it leaves us with a question we didn't have before.
What is the relation between these abilities to segment objects, represent them as persisting 
and track their causal interactions and knowledge about objects?
Clearly having an object-index stuck to an object is not the same thing as having knowledge
about the object's location and movements.  (If it were, we'd face just the problems that are 
fatal for the Simple View.)
What then is the relation between these things?

          <div class="notes">This third point is related to an issue about the relation between infant and adult capacities,
one that  I raised at the start of this lecture ...

This would require a time-consuming analysis that is not always possible. In order to have a survival advantage, the process of extrapolation should be fast and effortless, without much conscious deliberation.

The empirical evidence is clear that (1) displacement does not always correspond to predictions based on physical principles and (2) variables unrelated to physical principles (e.g., the presence of landmarks, target identity, or expectations regarding a change in target direction) can influence displacement. ... information based on a naive understanding of physical principles or on subjective consequences of physical principles appears to be just one of many types of information that could potentially contribute to the displacement of any given target' \citep[p.\ 842]{hubbard:2005_representational}</div>

If both infants and adults are subjects to the same signature limits, namely those associated
with impetus mechanics, then we can infer that the representations of physical objects in 
adult 's perceptual processes originate from the same source as infants' representations of

        <div class="notes">In this lecture I've been considering two interlocking themes simultaneously.
The first is the problem I introduced in the last lecture, which arises from
the failure of the Simple View.

        <div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">I suggested that a key step in solving this problem is the link between the Principles of
Object Perception and object indexes.
The Principles are not items of knowledge, nor do they generate knowledge about particular 
objects.
Rather, the Principles characterise the operation of object indexes, and object indexes give
rise to perceptual expectations.
And, as we've just seen, perceptual expectations are not knowledge.

The problem is to understand the relation between infants' abilities regarding physical objects
and the Spelke principles which describe these given that the principles and their deliverances
are not actually knowledge.
The other theme is knowledge of causal interactions.

On causal interactions, my question is: How do infants first acquire knowledge of causal 
interactions among objects.
I want to approach this question in an odd way, by thinking about the perception of causation
in adults.
My hope is that focussing on the perception of causation might help us to make progress 
with both themes simultaneously.

How do humans first come to know about causes?

        <div class="notes">I approached this question by asking a subquestion, Can humans perceive causal interactions?
We've seen that, roughly speaking, the answer is yes.
Humans, including infants from around 6 months or earlier, do have perceptual processes that 
function to track certain kinds of causal interactions among objects.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">But how does this information about perceptual processes relate to knowledge?
This is the Next Big Problem.

          <p class="center">The Next Big Problem</p>
          <div class="notes">Our Next Big Problem is this.
We've said that infants' competence with causes and objects is not knowledge but something 
more primitive than knowledge, something which exists in adults too and can carry information
discrepant with what they know.
So, if at all, how does appealing to these early capacities enable us to explain the origins 
of knowledge?

    <div class="container_12">
      <div class="grid_12">
        <div class="notes">Broadly, my suggestion will be that the competence which appears in the first months of 
development leads to knowledge of objects and causes only in conjunction with various
additional things, like social interaction, perhaps language and abilities to use tools.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">The picture I want to offer differs from those of researchers like Vygotsky and Tomasello in 
that there is an essential role for early-developing forms of representation that are more
primitive that concepts or thoughts and do not appear to have any kind of social origin.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">But the picture also differs from those of researchers like Spelke and Carey in that these
early developing forms of representation are only one of several components that are needed
to understand the origins of knowledge.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">To explore this idea I want to switch to a completely different domain, colour.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">[*Aside on tool use:]
Basic forms of tool use may not require understanding how objects interact 
(Barrett, Davis, & Needham; Lockman, 2000), and may depend on core cognition of 
contact-mechanics (Goldenberg & Hagmann, 1998; Johnson-Frey, 2004). 
Experience of tool use may in turn assist children in understanding notions of manipulation, 
a key causal notion (Menzies & Price, 1993; Woodward, 2003). Perhaps non-core capacities for 
causal representation are not innate but originate with experiences of tool use.
